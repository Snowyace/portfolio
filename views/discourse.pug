	strong Discourse
	| is an interactive lecture service that facilitates collaborative learning and provides analytics for professors. Unlike other platforms, Discourse facilitates collaborative learning and in-class activities that produces comprehensive learning materials.

p Over a 10 week period, our team of 4 sought to understand the classroom environment and the technologies used to enhance learning. Through observations, interviews, and service enactments, we found essential needs to iterate on. 

h2 Why did we create Discourse?
p Learning shouldn't be a passive experience. Large lecture halls today paint a rather dismal picture - students, with their eyes glued to laptop screens, and professors droned out in the background. The current learning environment doesn't facilitate learning. Students often rush to cram all the information they didn't learn in class the night before their midterms and finals.
p Discourse aims to harness ubiquitous, always on devices as a boon instead of a distraction. We can facilitate learning and make lecture time valuable by taking advantage of some key insights in the science of education.

h2 Design Process
h3 Understanding the Education Space
p First, we brainstormed grievances and occurances about college life under 4 general sectors: Social, Technological, Economical, and Political. This allowed us to hone into a niche of opportunities.

h2 How Might We 
ul
	li How might we create easy-to-use and unambiguous channels for communication between students, professors, and TAs?
	li How might we foster student etiquette and professionalism to create a reliable platform for prompt and helpful answers? 
	li How might we enable students to collaboratively interact with, annotate, discuss, and transform the professorâ€™s content?

p From here, we conducted interviews and observed students in lecture to develop questions on where we could improve learning. 
p Using our ethnographic data, we each created our own solutions through storyboarding. With parallel design, we can see the commonalities between each design, and which were a unique approach. Through parallel design, we iterated rapidly without being hungup on trying to form multiple solutions.

h2 Competitive Analysis
p We analyzed current tools and services being used to understand why each would be used, and why someone would use our service rather than established tools.

p To do so, we developed user scenarios where persona may interact with our proposed service in the face of a problem.

h2 Roleplaying and Enactments
p To test our service if it would be feasible we created a scenario in which a student will go through a lecture and will be periodically interrupted with given activities. To mimic a live lecture while still being able to control the pacing of the class, I proposed for our users to listen to a podcast of a lecture. 
p Podcasts allowed us to:
ul
	li pause at any moment to do an activity
	li reduce confounds of split attention between the professor lecturing and the student doing an activity
	li focus on how receptive users are to the handed activities. 

p We listened to the selected podcast beforehand to match our activities with the lecture content. We interrupt the student upon reaching an activity moment, and have them do the activity proposed on the google survey form to record their responses.

p At the end of the enactment, we have students evaluate their experiences.

h2 Brand Identity
p Before naming our service Discourse, we explored abstract concepts and adjectives paired with various color schemes. 
p We came up with Discourse as a double entendre. "This course" and Discourse as in opening a dialogue.

h2 Pitching Our Service
p For our A/B Testing, we developed two mock websites paired with different advertisements pitched to different demographics to see which pair would generate the most clicks and sign ups.
